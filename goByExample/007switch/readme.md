# Switch

Switch statements express conditionals across many branches.

Commas can be used to separate multiple expressions in the `case` statement, e.g. `case time.Saturday, time.Sunday`.

`default` case is optional.

switch without an expression is an alternate way to express `if/else` logic.
Case expressions can be non-constants.

A type switch compares types instead of values.
Can use type switch to discover the type of an interface value.
