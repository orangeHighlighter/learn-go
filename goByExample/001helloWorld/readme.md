# Hello World

## Commentary to main.go file

`import` imports packages

To run the program, use the command `go run main.go` while in `~/heraclea/golanggocode/src/github.com/saraginov/goByExample/001helloWorld`

Sometimes we want to build our programs into binaries, we can do this using `go build` instead.
We can then execute the built binary directly.

Note to self: I don't see an advantage of building binary yet, especially during
development process...
