# For

`for` is Go's only looping construct.

Most basic type has a single condition: `for i <= 3 {}`
A classic initial/condition/after `for` loop: `for j:=7; j<=9; j++ {}`
`for` without a condition will loop repeatedly until you `break` out of the loop
`or return` from the enclosing function

You can also `continue` to the next iteration of the loop.

`for` forms will expand with `range` statements, channels and other data structures.
