# Functions

Functions are central in Go.

Go requires explicit returns, i.e. won't automatically return the value of the
last expression.

When there are multiple consecutive parameters of the same type, you may omit
the type name for the like-typed parameters, up to the final parameter that
declares the type.

Call a function as expected `name(args)`
