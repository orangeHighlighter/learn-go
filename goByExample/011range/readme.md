# Range

`range()` iterates over elements in a variety of data structures.
`range()` on arrays and slices provides both the index and value for each
entry.

We ignore variables using the blank identifier `_` (underscore).

`range()` on a map iterates over key/value pairs; can also iterate over just
the keys of a map.

`range()` on strings iterates over Unicode code points.
The first value is the starting byte index of the rune and the second the rune
itself.
